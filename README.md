# TSLA Stock Prediction 

Welcome to the TSLA Stock Prediction project! This project explores various machine learning models to predict the stock prices of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). By leveraging advanced techniques and comparing multiple models, this project aims to provide accurate and reliable predictions for TSLA stock prices.

Key Features:
Data Collection: The project uses historical stock price data of Tesla, including features such as opening and closing prices, trading volume, and more.

Preprocessing: The data undergoes extensive preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure the highest quality and accuracy.

Model Comparison: Various machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, are employed and compared to determine the best performing model.

Mambas and Jambas: Experimentation with novel techniques named "Mambas" and "Jambas" to enhance the prediction accuracy and model robustness.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

Visualization: Visualizations of the data and model predictions are created using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing insightful and clear representations of the results.
